## Assessment Assignment:
### Assignments:
Will require use of R and data science tools in solving real data science
problems.  Projects will also require demonstration of the elements of
reproducible research.

### Final project:
Will contain questions about the capabilities of different software tools and
questions about the principles of good data science.

# Course Grading Scale(s)
Final course grades will be determined using the following [UNC Graduate School
grading scale](https://handbook.unc.edu/grading.html).  The relative weight of each 
course component is shown in the Graded Assignments table.

| Grade | Description | Numeric Value |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| H | High Pass: Clear excellence | 93-100 |
| P | Pass: Entirely satisfactory graduate work | 80-92 |
| L | Low Pass: Inadequate graduate work | 0-79 |
| F | Fail | 0-69 |

Final course grades will be determined using the following UNC [Undergraduate
School grading system](https://registrar.unc.edu/academic-services/grades/explanation-of-grading-system/).

| Grade | Description | Numeric Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Mastery of course content at the highest level of attainment that can reasonably be expected of students at a given stage of development. The A grade  states clearly that the students have shown such outstanding promise in the aspect of the discipline under study that he/she may be strongly encouraged to continue. | 90-100 |
| B | Strong performance demonstrating a high level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development. The B grade states that the student has shown solid promise in the aspect of the discipline under study. | 80-89 |
| C | A totally acceptable performance demonstrating an adequate level of attainment for a student at a given stage of development. The C grade states that, while not yet showing unusual promise, the student may continue to study in the discipline with reasonable hope of intellectual development. | 70-79 |
| D | A marginal performance in the required exercises demonstrating a minimal passing level of attainment. A student has given no evidence of prospective growth in the discipline; an accumulation of D grades should be taken to mean that the student would be well advised not to continue in the academic field.| 60-69 | 
| F | For whatever reason, an unacceptable performance. The F grade indicates that the student’s performance in the required exercises has revealed almost no understanding of the course content. A grade of F should warrant an advisor’s questioning whether the student may suitably register for further study in the discipline before remedial work is undertaken.| 50-59 |

# Instructor Expectations:
## Discussion Forum
The instructor will be an active reader and will occasionally post throughout the
semester. The group discussion forum will be moderated by the group members unless an
issue is brought to the instructor’s attention by a fellow group member. The course
discussion forum will be hosted on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/bios512/shared_invite/enQtNzMxNzAxNDc5NzE5LThhMGZiZDQzYzUwYzhmNmU4ZTgyNjMxYzg2ZGM1MTQ1ZDYzM2Y2Zjg5M2M3NTQ0YTlkMmIzNTRkMGZmMDQyOTc).

## Email/Contact
The preferred way to contact the instructor is on the course Slack channel. The 
instructor will typically respond to a message within 24 hours or less if sent Monday
through Friday. The instructor may respond to weekend message, but it is not required of them. If
you receive an out of office reply when emailing, it may take longer to receive a reply. The
instructor will provide advance notice, if possible, when they will be out of the office.

## Feedback
All graded assignments will receive written feedback that coincides with the
assessment rubric. Feedback is meant to be constructive and help the student continue to build
upon their skills. The types of feedback you may receive are descriptive feedback, evaluative
feedback, and motivational feedback. Feedback is a tool that you as a learner can use to
understand the areas that you are succeeding in and what you can do to improve in other areas.

## Grading
Assignments will be graded no more than four weeks after the due date. Assignments that build on 
the next assignment will be graded within one week of the final due
date. Early submissions will not be graded before the final due date.

## Syllabus Changes
The instructor reserves the right to make changes to the syllabus, including
topics, readings, assignments, and due dates. Any changes will be announced as
early as possible. For session-by-session course schedule details, please see
below.

## Appropriate Use of Course Resources
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, syllabus,
exams, quizzes, and assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized
copying of the class materials is a violation of federal law and may result in
disciplinary actions being taken against the student.  Additionally, the
sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the
instructor may be a violation of the University&#39;s Student Honor Code and an
act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.
This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for
the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students.

## Assignments
Submit all assignments via GitHub or GitHub Classroom. Emailing assignments is
not acceptable unless prior arrangements have been made.

## Attendance/Participation
Your attendance and active participation are an integral part of your learning
experience in this course. If you are unavoidably absent, please notify the
course instructor (and Teaching Assistant if one is assigned).

## Communication
You are expected to follow common courtesy in all communication to include
email, discussion forums, and face-to-face. All electronic communications sent
should follow proper English grammar rules to include complete sentences. This
is a professional course, and you are expected to communicate as a
professional.

## Contributions
You are expected to offer individual contributions in class and on individual
assignments, and collaborate with fellow students on assignments for which
students may work together, such as group assignments.

## Honor Code
To ensure effective functioning of the Honor System at UNC, students are expected to:
- Conduct all academic work within the letter and spirit of the Honor Code,
  which prohibits the giving or receiving of unauthorized aid in all academic
  processes.
- Learn the recognized techniques of proper attribution of sources used in
  written work; and to identify allowable resource materials or aids to be used
  during completion of any graded work.
- Students may use materials they wrote for other courses, but only if the
  student themselves produced the work.
- For homework, students may verbally discuss approaches to the
  problems but each student should independently write up the answer and verify
  solutions.

See Additional Resources and Policies for additional information.

## Inclusive Excellence
In this class, we practice the Gillings School’s commitment to inclusion,
diversity, and equity in the following ways. See Additional Resources and
Policies for additional information.
- Treat all members of the Gillings community (students, faculty, and staff) as
  human persons of equal worth who deserve dignity and respect, even in moments
  of conflict and disagreement.
- Contribute to creating a welcoming and inclusive classroom environment, where
  all are able to learn and grow from one another.
- Acknowledge and respect the diversity of experiences that others bring to the
  classroom and the ways in which this richness enhances everyone’s learning
- Strive to maintain a spirit of curiosity and generosity, particularly in the
  face of new and/or seemingly contradictory information and perspectives
  Encourage and solicit feedback from students to continually improve inclusive practices.

## Late Work
Assignment due dates will not be changed because of exams or assignments in
other courses or because of conflicting vacation travel plans. Late submissions
will receive a 10% point reduction for every day that they are late. After
seven days, late submissions will receive no points. Corrected submissions will
not be accepted unless stated otherwise. You must inform the instructor on the
first week of class if you cannot attend an exam or presentation due to
extenuating circumstances, such as medical procedures or professional travel.
Attendance on the day of the presentation and exams is otherwise required to
receive points for those activities.

## Readings
Readings for a particular class should be completed before the class session
and before completing associated activities.

## Technical support
The best way to help prevent technical issues from causing problems for
assignments and quizzes is to submit them at least 24-36 hours before the due
date and time. Your instructor cannot resolve technical issues, but it’s
important to notify them if you are experiencing issues. If you have problems
submitting an assignment or taking a quiz in Sakai, immediately do the
following:
1. Contact he UNC Information Technology Services (ITS) department with the
   time you attempted to do your course action and what the course action was.
2. Send a Slack message to your instructor with the information you sent to ITS
   and what time you sent the information.

The ITS department provides technical support 24-hours per day, seven days per
week. If you need computer help, please contact the ITS Help Desk by phone at
+1-919-962-HELP (919- 962-4357), or by online help request at
http://help.unc.edu/help/olhr, or by UNC Live Chat at http://help.unc.edu/chat.
