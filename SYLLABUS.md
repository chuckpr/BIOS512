1. achieve proficiency in the R programming language, with particular emphasis
   on the Tidyverse;
1. gain familiarity with a suite of data science tools;
1. master the practices of good data science; and,
1. learn how to apply the methods and tools to public health datasets.

# Prerequisites
This course is required for MPH students with concentration in Public Health
Data Science and is appropriate for master's students in quantitative fields.
PhD students in computer science, business, psychology, social science, and
science may also find this course useful. There are no pre-requisites beyond

topics, readings, assignments, and due dates. Any changes will be announced as
early as possible. For session-by-session course schedule details, please see below,

# Course Assignments and Assessments
This course will include the following graded assignments that contribute to
your final grade in the course. For assignment descriptions and assignment
grading rubrics, please see

# Map of Competencies to Learning Objectives and Assessment Assignments
Below you will see the competency you will develop in this course, the learning
objectives that comprise the competency, and the assignment in which you will
practice demonstrating this competency.

## Competency:
Select and use data visualization methods to interpret and communicate research
results, with the overall objective of conducting reproducible research, both
individually and in project teams.

## Learning Objectives:
1. Achieve proficiency in the R programming language.
1. Gain familiarity with a suite of data science tools, including data
   wrangling, data quality control, data cleaning/editing, exploratory data
   analysis, and data visualization.
1. Understand the principles of good data science, particularly reproducible
   research.
1. Become familiar with several software tools for best practices in data
   science including Git, Docker, Jupyter, and Make.
1. Apply the data science tools and principles of best practice to real data
   problems in public health settings.

## Assessment Assignment:
### Assignments:
Will require use of R and data science tools in solving real data science
problems.  Projects will also require demonstration of the elements of
reproducible research.

### Final project:
Will contain questions about the capabilities of different software tools and
questions about the principles of good data science.

# Course Grading Scale(s)
Final course grades will be determined using the following UNC Graduate School
grading scale.  The relative weight of each course component is shown in the
Graded Assignments table.

Final course grades will be determined using the following UNC Undergraduate
School grading system.

## Syllabus Changes
The instructor reserves the right to make changes to the syllabus, including
topics, readings, assignments, and due dates. Any changes will be announced as
early as possible. For session-by-session course schedule details, please see
below.

## Appropriate Use of Course Resources
The materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, syllabus,
exams, quizzes, and assignments are copyright protected works. Any unauthorized
copying of the class materials is a violation of federal law and may result in
disciplinary actions being taken against the student.  Additionally, the
sharing of class materials without the specific, express approval of the
instructor may be a violation of the University&#39;s Student Honor Code and an
act of academic dishonesty, which could result in further disciplinary action.
This includes, among other things, uploading class materials to websites for
the purpose of sharing those materials with other current or future students.

## Assignments
Submit all assignments via GitHub or GitHub Classroom. Emailing assignments is
not acceptable unless prior arrangements have been made.

## Attendance/Participation
Your attendance and active participation are an integral part of your learning
experience in this course. If you are unavoidably absent, please notify the
course instructor (and Teaching Assistant if one is assigned).

## Communication
You are expected to follow common courtesy in all communication to include
email, discussion forums, and face-to-face. All electronic communications sent
should follow proper English grammar rules to include complete sentences. This
is a professional course, and you are expected to communicate as a
professional.

## Contributions
You are expected to offer individual contributions in class and on individual
assignments, and collaborate with fellow students on assignments for which
students may work together, such as group assignments.

## Honor Code
To ensure effective functioning of the Honor System at UNC, students are expected to:
- Conduct all academic work within the letter and spirit of the Honor Code,
  which prohibits the giving or receiving of unauthorized aid in all academic
  processes.
- Learn the recognized techniques of proper attribution of sources used in
  written work; and to identify allowable resource materials or aids to be used
  during completion of any graded work.
- Students may use materials they wrote for other courses, but only if the
  student themselves produced the work.
- For homework, students may verbally discuss approaches to the
  problems but each student should independently write up the answer and verify
  solutions.

See Additional Resources and Policies for additional information.

## Inclusive Excellence
In this class, we practice the Gillings School’s commitment to inclusion,
diversity, and equity in the following ways. See Additional Resources and
Policies for additional information.
- Treat all members of the Gillings community (students, faculty, and staff) as
  human persons of equal worth who deserve dignity and respect, even in moments
  of conflict and disagreement.
- Contribute to creating a welcoming and inclusive classroom environment, where
  all are able to learn and grow from one another.
- Acknowledge and respect the diversity of experiences that others bring to the
  classroom and the ways in which this richness enhances everyone’s learning
- Strive to maintain a spirit of curiosity and generosity, particularly in the
  face of new and/or seemingly contradictory information and perspectives
  Encourage and solicit feedback from students to continually improve inclusive practices.

## Late Work
Assignment due dates will not be changed because of exams or assignments in
other courses or because of conflicting vacation travel plans. Late submissions
will receive a 10% point reduction for every day that they are late. After
seven days, late submissions will receive no points. Corrected submissions will
not be accepted unless stated otherwise. You must inform the instructor on the
first week of class if you cannot attend an exam or presentation due to
extenuating circumstances, such as medical procedures or professional travel.
Attendance on the day of the presentation and exams is otherwise required to
receive points for those activities.

## Readings
Readings for a particular class should be completed before the class session
and before completing associated activities.

## Technical support
The best way to help prevent technical issues from causing problems for
assignments and quizzes is to submit them at least 24-36 hours before the due
date and time. Your instructor cannot resolve technical issues, but it’s
important to notify them if you are experiencing issues. If you have problems
submitting an assignment or taking a quiz in Sakai, immediately do the
following:
1. Contact he UNC Information Technology Services (ITS) department with the
   time you attempted to do your course action and what the course action was.
2. Send a Slack message to your instructor with the information you sent to ITS
   and what time you sent the information.

The ITS department provides technical support 24-hours per day, seven days per
week. If you need computer help, please contact the ITS Help Desk by phone at
+1-919-962-HELP (919- 962-4357), or by online help request at
http://help.unc.edu/help/olhr, or by UNC Live Chat at http://help.unc.edu/chat.
